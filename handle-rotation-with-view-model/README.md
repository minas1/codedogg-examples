# Easy rotation handling with ViewModel

Rotation handling on Android is difficult, so many apps lock their orientations to portrait mode.

This has the following effects:
* It disallows users to use them in landscape mode
* Tablets that default in landscape mode don't play well with those apps (as they need to rotated)

This sample shows how `ViewModel` of Android Jetpack can help implement rotation handling.
